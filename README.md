### To get started, install supercollider and load 
### the code in [First](First/README.md) to test your setup
### and to confirm that you have audio output.
####
### Next, add the BBCut2 library, copy the amen.wav (or other breatbeat you choose) to 'sounds',
### load an sc from [Second](Second/README.md) and edit it to include the correct path to your wav
### then 'evaluate' it to confirm BBCut2 and loading a local audio file works.
